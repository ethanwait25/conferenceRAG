## ConferenceRAG
Compares sentiment vector of user input to LDS General Conference talk vectors. Selects most relevent talk data (full text or paragraphs) and forms query to GPT-4o to generate responses and make talk recommendations. Retrieval agumented generation.

### Embedding Modes
Utilizes both OpenAI's embedding API and sentence_transformers's SentenceTransformer. OpenAI embeddings are more accurate and useful, but the SentenceTransformer's free embeddings work surprisingly well.

### Vector Comparison Strategy
Uses Euclidean distance to select the closest talks or talk paragraphs to a target user prompt vector.

## Prompts
The prompting to GPT-4o follows the following structure:
1. Talk(s) or paragraph(s) text, title, author, year
2. Request prompt (depends on mode)
3. User question

### Request Prompts
- **Quote mode**: "Using only the above text, extract the three quotes that best answer the question. Attribute the speaker and talk using the format '[Quote] - [Speaker], \"[Talk]\" ([Conference])'. Do not number the quotes. The question is: "
- **Explain mode**: "Using the above text, explain in your own words the answer to the user's question. Suggest one or two of the above talks for further reading. Keep your response fairly short, but attempt to answer the question as well as possible with the above information. Do not reference that there are talks above, just answer the question. The question is: "

## Examples
Question: *I want to increase my faith.*
