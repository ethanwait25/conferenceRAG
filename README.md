## ConferenceRAG
Compares sentiment vector of user input to LDS General Conference talk vectors. Selects most relevent talk data (full text or paragraphs) and forms query to GPT-4o to generate responses and make talk recommendations. Retrieval agumented generation.

### Embedding Modes
Utilizes both OpenAI's embedding API and sentence_transformers's SentenceTransformer. OpenAI embeddings are more accurate and useful, but the SentenceTransformer's free embeddings work surprisingly well.

### Vector Comparison Strategy
Uses Euclidean distance to select the closest talks or talk paragraphs to a target user prompt vector.

## Prompts
The prompting to GPT-4o follows the following structure:
1. Talk(s) or paragraph(s) text, title, author, year
2. Request prompt (depends on mode)
3. User question

### Request Prompts
- **Quote mode**: "Using only the above text, extract the three quotes that best answer the question. Attribute the speaker and talk using the format '[Quote] - [Speaker], \"[Talk]\" ([Conference])'. Do not number the quotes. The question is: "
- **Explain mode**: "Using the above text, explain in your own words the answer to the user's question. Suggest one or two of the above talks for further reading. Keep your response fairly short, but attempt to answer the question as well as possible with the above information. Do not reference that there are talks above, just answer the question. The question is: "

## Examples
### Question: _I want to increase my faith._

| OpenAI, Paragraphs              | Explain         | Loving those who are unkind to you involves striving to emulate the love of Christ by extending compassion and kindness, even to those who may wish you harm. This means seeing them as fellow children of a higher power and treating them with respect. One important step is to pray for those who mistreat you, as this can help transform your feelings of hurt into understanding and love. By manifesting even the smallest acts of kindness towards them, you may find an unexpected power to influence your own heart and possibly theirs. For further guidance, you might explore teachings that focus on compassion and missionary work, which often emphasize these principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

My young sisters, it is not pleasing to the Lord if we are cruel or mean to others." - President Dallin H. Oaks, "Parents and Children" (2018).<br><br>"They want you to repent because that is the path to happiness. But it is your choice They honor your agency. You must choose to love Them, to serve Them, to keep Their commandments. Then They can more abundantly bless you as well as love you." - Elder D.

| SentenceTransformer, Paragraphs | Explain         | Loving those who are unkind to you can be challenging, but it is possible by focusing on kindness and understanding the broader perspective of love and growth. First, recognize that kindness has a powerful impact on you and others. By choosing kindness, even in difficult situations, you can foster a more positive environment and potentially influence others towards improvement.<br>It's important to understand that everyone is capable of being unkind at times, and recognizing this can help you approach others with more empathy. Be aware that persistent unkindness, like bullying, is not righteous behavior and does not please the Lord. However, by approaching those who are unkind with compassion and forgiveness, you exemplify higher principles of love.<br>Remember, loving others involves making a conscious choice to act with love and serve them, even when it is difficult. By doing so, you allow yourself to grow and create the space for others to change as well. Choosing to respond to unkindness with love can lead you to true joy and success, as it aligns with the path of happiness and personal growth. It might be helpful to consider reading about the perspective of love and kindness from the talks by Sharon Eubank and Elder D. Todd Christofferson as they offer valuable insights into these concepts. |

| OpenAI, Paragraphs              | Explain         | If your car won't start, it might be due to a power issue, similar to when a battery-powered model car loses charge. First, check if the car's battery is weak or dead. You can try jump-starting the car with jumper cables and another vehicle, or use a battery charger to recharge the battery. If the problem persists, it could be related to other components like the engine or fuel system. In that case, consider consulting a mechanic to diagnose and address the issue. It's essential to keep your car's battery charged and regularly maintained. Additionally, maintaining a habit of checking essential car components can prevent future issues.                                                                                |

The excerpts from speeches by Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, President Russell M. Nelson, and Elder Patrick Kearon are about spiritual and personal guidance, rather than mechanical advice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| SentenceTransformer, Paragraphs | Explain         | To address a car that won't start, begin by diagnosing the common issues. Check the battery to ensure it's charged and connections are tight and clean, as a dead or disconnected battery is often the culprit. Next, examine the starter and ignition system, verifying that the key turns properly and the starter motor is functioning. Additionally, inspect the fuel system; ensure that there's enough fuel and that the fuel pump is working. If these quick checks don't solve the problem, it might be beneficial to seek professional assistance, as the issue could be more complex. For inspiration on resilience, consider exploring talks that focus on overcoming challenges and finding strength even when feeling beyond repair. |

## Recommendation Mode
In Recommendation Mode, the system recommends the talks whose embedding vectors are most similar to the userâ€™s prompt. These are the talks whose full texts or paragraphs would be sent to GPT-4o in Quote or Explain Mode. In this mode, there is no communication with GPT-4o and talks are returned immediately. Following are examples of this mode, all using OpenAI talk embedding.
